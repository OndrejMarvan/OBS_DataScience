# USL Project 1 
Expected output is to do a choose athe most suitable clustering method, do the cluestering and then forecasting. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Install missing library on local machine
install.packages("NbClust")
# Load other necessary and already installed libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(cluster)    # For PAM and basic clustering
library(factoextra) # For clustering visualizations
library(NbClust)    # For determining the optimal number of clusters
```

# 1. Data Discrovery 

Before diving into clustering, I need to decide what do I want to do with the data and as well to understand to them. The key idea is to compare historical year with the latest available year (meaning 2024). 
```
