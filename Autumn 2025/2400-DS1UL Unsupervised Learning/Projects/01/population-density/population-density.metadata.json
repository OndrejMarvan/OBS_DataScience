We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).\n\n**World**\n- Before 1800: we use data from HYDE.\n- 1800-1950: we estimate the global population by summing all available countries in the dataset.\n- After 1950, we rely on estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.",
