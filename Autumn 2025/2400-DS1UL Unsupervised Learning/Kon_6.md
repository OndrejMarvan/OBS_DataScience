Dimension reduction why? 
- every single value is a dimension
- many dimensions may overfit the dimensions
- no added value to add highly correlated values, we can drop one of them -> which one? The one that is more suitable to keep in the dataset 
- use of Lasso model = automatically takes the variables that fits the best to the dataset
- important is the cariance behind the data
- data reduction to 90-95% is fine (e.g. 50% would be non-sense)

## PCA = Principal Component Analysis
