    "<p><strong>What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?</strong></p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code based on objects. These objects contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for clearer and more logical code structures.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Why do we need OOP instead of just functions?</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>The traditional procedural approach relies on functions and variables, but as code becomes more complex, managing it becomes more difficult. Object-oriented programming solves this by grouping data and operations on that data within objects, which improves code organization and readability.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Key advantages of OOP:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>Code reusability –</strong> The ability to reuse classes and objects in different parts of a program or in other projects.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Modularity –</strong> Code is divided into independent modules (classes), making it easier to manage and develop.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Scalability –</strong> OOP makes it easier to extend applications without major changes to existing code.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Easier debugging –</strong> Thanks to the division into classes and objects, it is easier to track errors and diagnose issues in the code.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Ultimately, OOP helps write more organized, flexible, and maintainable code.</p>\n"

    "\n",
    "<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a technique that helps manage complex software projects. Most analysts will not work independently on such solutions, but this knowledge is very useful, for example when creating your own package.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The concept of object-oriented programming allows you to look holistically at the process of collecting and processing data. It involves defining new types of objects (called <strong>classes</strong>) and the functions or operations assigned to them (called <strong>methods</strong>).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Objects</strong> are, in this approach, concrete instances of classes, while classes are a way of grouping objects into sets of units with shared characteristics. For each class we can define a list of characteristics, and then assign specific values of those characteristics to each object.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Working with classes allows us to more efficiently organize our knowledge and create representations of real-world objects within computer programs.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For example, salmon, eel, and whale shark are representatives of the class “fish” (even though they differ greatly from each other). If we say “Nemo is a fish,” then even people who don’t know the Disney movie can easily list some characteristics of that “object”:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>* it has fins, <br>\n",
    "* it breathes with gills <br>\n",
    "* it has no voice.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Most programming languages have a single class system.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In R, four independent class systems are available: S3, S4, Reference Class (RC or R5), and the increasingly popular R6 system. We also have the “base” system, which contains the most fundamental classes of objects in R: <code>numeric</code>, <code>character</code>, <code>factor</code>, <code>list</code>, etc.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>These systems coexist, each with different features and properties, which we will discuss below.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Programming language features that are important from the perspective of object-oriented programming:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>* polymorphism — the ability to create <strong>methods</strong> (functions) whose behavior (result) may depend on the type (<strong>class</strong>) of the object passed as an argument<br>\n",
    "* inheritance — the ability to create a new class based on an existing one by specifying that the new class is a special case of the existing class.</p>\n"
