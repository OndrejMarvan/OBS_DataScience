> > Supervised Learning Definition Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data — that is, each training example has an input and a corresponding correct output. The goal: learn a mapping from inputs X to outputs Y . Common algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Decision Trees Support Vector Machines (SVM) Neural Networks Used for: classification, regression, prediction.

> > Unsupervised Learning Definition Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data — where the algorithm tries to find hidden structure or patterns without predefined outputs. The goal: discover structure, similarity, or relationships in data. Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering Hierarchical Clustering Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Association Rule Mining Used for: grouping, dimensionality reduction, pattern discovery.


Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence focused on
learning patterns from data.
Two main paradigms:
1 Supervised Learning
2 Unsupervised Learning
