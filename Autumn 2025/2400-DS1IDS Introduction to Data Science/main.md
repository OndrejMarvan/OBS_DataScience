> > Supervised Learning Definition Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data — that is, each training example has an input and a corresponding correct output. The goal: learn a mapping from inputs X to outputs Y . Common algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Decision Trees Support Vector Machines (SVM) Neural Networks Used for: classification, regression, prediction.

> > Unsupervised Learning Definition Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data — where the algorithm tries to find hidden structure or patterns without predefined outputs. The goal: discover structure, similarity, or relationships in data. Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering Hierarchical Clustering Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Association Rule Mining Used for: grouping, dimensionality reduction, pattern discovery.


## L1
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence focused on
learning patterns from data.
Two main paradigms:
1 Supervised Learning
2 Unsupervised Learning

Q1. Foundations of Data Science
According to IBM’s view, what best describes Data Science?
A) The study of human–computer interaction in social networks
**B) Combining math/statistics, programming, advanced**
**analytics/AI and domain expertise to extract insights**
C) The process of collecting data for statistical testing

Q2. Econometrics vs Data Science
Which statement correctly contrasts the two fields?
A) Econometrics focuses on prediction; data science focuses on causality
**B) Econometrics prioritizes interpretation/validity; data**
**science prioritizes prediction/scalability**
C) Both fields ignore statistical assumptions
 
Q3. Types of Learning
In supervised learning, models are trained on:
A) Unlabeled data with unknown outputs
**B) Data with known input–output pairs**
C) Randomly generated data without structure

Q4. Structured vs unstructured data
Which of the following are unstructured data?
A) Relational database
**B) Tweets**
**C) Photos/images**

Q5. Objective of ML
Main objective of machine learning:
A) Testing economic theories
B) Automating data collection
**C) Learning patterns from data to improve task performance**

Q6. Data leakage
What is data leakage?
A) Loss of records during preprocessing
**B) Using test-set information during training**
C) Incorrect encoding of categorical variables

Q7. What is NOT true about Data Science?
Which of the following statements correctly define Data Science?
A) It focuses solely on collecting raw data without analysis
B) It excludes programming and statistics entirely
C) It avoids using any computational tools
**Note: In this question, none of the options are correct.**

Question 1. Which of the following are unstructured data?
1A) Photos/images
2B) Tweets
3C) Relational database
The **correct answers are (a) and (b)**. Therefore, the following provided
answers yield these point values:


## L03
### Data collection methods
**Quantitative methods:**
- standardized surveys,
- controlled experiments,
- analysis of transactions and system logs,
- KPI monitoring,
- technical tests and measurements,
- GPS data analysis.

**Qualitative methods:**
- in-depth interviews,
- participant observation,
- case studies,
- content analysis (texts, media),
- ethnographic and field research.
