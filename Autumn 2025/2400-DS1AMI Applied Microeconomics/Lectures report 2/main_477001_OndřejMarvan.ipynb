    "\n",
    "Our CAS analysis is complete and has yielded several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Properties (Internal):** The \"production function\" for winning (`p_A`) is well-behaved: it's monotonic (more spending helps) and concave (it has diminishing returns).\n",
    "2.  **Social Waste (Internal):** The function is homogeneous of degree 0, which mathematically proves the \"social waste\" argument: if all players increase spending, no one is better off.\n",
    "3.  **Equilibrium (Internal):** The model is **internally valid**. We symbolically derived the Nash Equilibrium for total spending: **Total Waste = (V * r) / 2**.\n",
    "4.  **Tullock Paradox (External):** The external validity of the model depends *entirely* on the `r` parameter.\n",
    "    * The paradox (that real-world waste seems low) is **resolved** if real-world contests are \"indecisive\" (i.e., **r < 1**). If `r=0.5`, only 25% of the prize value is wasted, which aligns much better with empirical observations.\n",
    "    * If `r = 2`, the model predicts *full dissipation* (100% of the prize is wasted), which is empirically unlikely.\n",
    "    * If `r > 2`, the model predicts players would waste *more* than the prize value, which is nonsensical.\n",
    "    * Therefore, the model is only externally plausible when `r` is assumed to be in the range (0, 2]."
