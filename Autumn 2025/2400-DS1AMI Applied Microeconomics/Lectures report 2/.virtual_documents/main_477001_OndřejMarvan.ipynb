# We set assumptions (positive=True) because spending (x), the prize (V),
# and the decisiveness parameter (r) must be positive.

# 2. DEFINE THE 'PRODUCTION FUNCTION' (TULLOCK CSF)
# This is p_A = (x_A^r) / (x_A^r + x_B^r)
# It 'produces' the probability of Player A winning.

# are both positive. The derivative is POSITIVE.
# Test PASSED.

# The result is -2*x_B / (x_A + x_B)**3.

# The scaling factor 't' completely cancels out.
# This means p_A is homogeneous of degree 0.

# their probabilities of winning DO NOT CHANGE. This is the
