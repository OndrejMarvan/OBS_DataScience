My Idea
Decarbonisation of Energy sector by country, take to consideration weather, coal accessibility

Combine clustering (identify typologies), spatial analysis (spillovers), and Monte Carlo simulation (future scenarios) into one comprehensive model of Europe’s energy transition.

Climate change, energy prices focus, expertise on energy prices and consumption, public tenders (BIP system, public tenders)

### Predictive Modeling and Forecasting 📈

- **Forecasting EUA Prices with Machine Learning**: You could develop and compare different machine learning models (like LSTMs, GRUs, or Prophet) to forecast European Union Allowance (EUA) prices. This could involve using a variety of data sources, such as historical EUA prices, energy prices (natural gas, coal, electricity), industrial production indices, and even weather data.
    
- **Volatility Modeling of Carbon Markets**: This thesis could focus on modeling and forecasting the volatility of EUA prices. You could use models like GARCH and its variants to understand the dynamics of carbon market risk. The business application would be in derivatives pricing and risk management for trading firms.

### Algorithmic Trading Strategies 🤖

- **Developing an AI-Based Trading Strategy for EUAs**: You could design and backtest an algorithmic trading strategy for EUAs using reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques. This would involve creating a simulated trading environment and training an AI agent to make profitable trading decisions.
    
- **Sentiment Analysis for Carbon Market News**: This project would involve using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze news articles, policy papers, and social media to gauge market sentiment. You could then use this sentiment score as a feature in a trading or price prediction model.

### Decarbonisation and Corporate Strategy 🌍

- **Optimizing Decarbonisation Pathways for a Specific Industry**: You could choose an industry covered by the EU ETS (e.g., cement, steel, or aviation) and use optimization techniques to find the most cost-effective decarbonisation pathway. This would involve analyzing the costs of different abatement technologies versus the cost of purchasing EUAs.
    
- **Corporate Carbon Portfolio Management**: This thesis could focus on developing a framework for companies to manage their portfolio of carbon assets (EUAs). You could apply Modern Portfolio Theory to help companies optimize their EUA holdings to minimize compliance costs and risk.

### Market Analysis and Econometrics 📊

- **The Impact of Policy Announcements on EUA Prices**: You could use econometric models to analyze the impact of specific EU policy announcements (like the "Fit for 55" package) on the price and volatility of EUAs. This would involve event study analysis and time series modeling.
    
- **Causal Inference in the EU ETS Market**: This project could use causal inference techniques to understand the causal relationships between different factors in the EU ETS. For example, you could investigate the causal effect of natural gas prices on EUA prices, isolating it from other confounding factors.
