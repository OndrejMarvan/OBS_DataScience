|ECTS credit allocation (and other scores):|3.00 <br><br>Basic information on ECTS credits allocation principles:<br><br>- the annual hourly workload of the student’s work required to achieve the expected learning outcomes for a given stage is 1500-1800h, corresponding to 60 ECTS;<br>- the student’s weekly hourly workload is 45 h;<br>- 1 ECTS point corresponds to 25-30 hours of student work needed to achieve the assumed learning outcomes;<br>- weekly student workload necessary to achieve the assumed learning outcomes allows to obtain 1.5 ECTS;<br>- work required to pass the course, which has been assigned 3 ECTS, constitutes 10% of the semester student load.|

|Short description:|Unsupervised learning course is focused on exploring data structure and extracting crucial information from unlabeled data without any particular variable of interest. The course is based on three subfields of unsupervised learning: clustering, dimension reduction and association rule learning. Both theoretical and practical aspects are going to be discussed. The course is realized in a computer lab. Passing requirements: group projects. The course is dedicated for graduate students (Econometrics and Informatics, Data Science).|
|Full description:|The main aim of the course is to make students familiar with research opportunities associated with data mining algorithms (Knowledge Discovery in Databases, KDD) and their usage in business applications. Three blocks of subjects are going to be fulfilled: clustering, dimension reduction and association rule learning.<br><br>Each of the blocks will be divided into four stages: i) introduction and construction of basic algorithms, ii) familiarization with accessible commands in R, their comparison and evaluation, iii) work with newest literature sources, iv) group project.<br><br>BLOCK 1: Clustering<br><br>Data research will be done by clustering. Several methods are going to be introduced: distance-based, k-means, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Clustering Large Applications (CLARA), Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search (CLARANS) or nonparametric clustering, hierarchical clustering, dictionary learning, linkage methods and probabilistic ones. Different ways of identifying the optimal number of clusters (CH index, Silhouette index) and agreement indices will be presented.<br><br>BLOCK 2: Dimension reduction<br><br>Analysis of main components of the principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (classic and metric), as well as actual non-linear dimension reduction methods.<br><br>BLOCK 3: Association rule learning<br><br>Main algorithms of association rules are going to be introduced (Apriori, Eclat, FP-growth, OPUS). They are applied i.a. in market based analysis and common patterns between purchased goods. Crucial measures of rules and transactions (support, confidence, lift, difference of consifence) will be described.<br><br>Models based on real data will be prepared (with cleaning and transforming the input data). Visualization methods of data regarding transactions, rules and clusters (also interactive), as well as simplifying tools for big data by sampling will be done. Examples of used packages: arules, arulesViz, stats, cluster, pdfCluster, clues i inne (see R TaskViews „Cluster” - Cluster Analysis & Finite Mixture Models).|
