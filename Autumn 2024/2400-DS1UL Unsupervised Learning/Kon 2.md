Some research papers are good, some are a bit crappy - we need to figure it out and work with it, critical comments, good and why...

Q: What is the difference between Superwised and Unsuperwised Learning? 

Always take a lokk at the literature - reinventing the wheel
Everything that we works was probably also invented
Reinventing the wheel 

Typos in data (min of teen age 3, max 106) -> always do crosscheck and validate the data 

Unspecified age could be determinded from graduation age/year variable - useful 

Why standardisation is so important? 
- you have two/three variables. 
- We do it keep the data equally, never skip

!Preferable to do at least part of the project in R Language, not just Python. 

kmeans fucntion(interest_z, 5)
Check number of clusters randomly which one suits the best 

Picked two dimensitons - age, friends - always creates biases but better for visualisation, up to us. 
- Run it through GGplots and waht is the best for us, e.g. with circles, barchart (distance from...), distribution cahrts, etc.
