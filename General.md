General but important notes

**text**

Project Ledger (23.10.2025)

How can we extract 2nd, 3rd and 5th value from a vector "A"? *
A[c(2,3,5)]
A[2,3,5]
**A[extract(2,3,5)]** correct
A(2,3,5)
A(c(2,3,5)) wrong answer


# 7. Create a vector of length 100, which will store consecutive numbers divisible by three. 
help(seq)
vec4 <- seq(from = 3, by = 3, length.out = 100)
vec4

**probably** a **mistake**
