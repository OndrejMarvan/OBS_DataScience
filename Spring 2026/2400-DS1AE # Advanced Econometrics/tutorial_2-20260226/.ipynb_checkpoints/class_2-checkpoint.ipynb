    "- Some states have better roads \n",
    "- Some states have more traffic   \n",

    "##### Interpretation: Fixed Effects Corrected vs Uncorrected\n",
    "\n",
    "The table compares two Fixed Effects models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uncorrected Fixed Effects model** – assumes no serial correlation.\n",
    "2. **Clustered Fixed Effects model** – corrects standard errors for serial correlation within states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models are estimated using the same data and variables, so the coefficients are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coefficient Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Beer Tax (beertax)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient on **beertax** is **-0.628** in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that an increase in beer tax by one unit is associated with a decrease of about **0.63 units in the fatality rate**, holding other factors constant within each state over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient is statistically significant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uncorrected model: significant at the **1% level (***)**\n",
    "- Clustered model: significant at the **5% level (**)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustered model has larger standard errors, which reduces statistical significance slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Minimum Legal Drinking Age (mlda)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient on **mlda** is **0.014** in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable is **not statistically significant** in either model, meaning there is no clear evidence that changes in drinking age affect the fatality rate in this specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard errors are larger in the clustered model:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Uncorrected SE | Clustered SE |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|--------------|\n",
    "| beertax | 0.191 | 0.303 |\n",
    "| mlda | 0.018 | 0.026 |\n",
    "| const | 0.390 | 0.603 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because clustered standard errors allow residuals to be correlated within states over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncorrected model assumes independent errors and therefore underestimates the variability of the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models have identical goodness-of-fit measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations = 336  \n",
    "- States = 48  \n",
    "- R² = 0.043\n",
    "\n",
    "This is expected because clustering affects only standard errors, not coefficient estimates or model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overall Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients are identical in both models, but the clustered model produces larger standard errors and slightly lower statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since serial correlation was detected in the residuals, the **clustered Fixed Effects model is preferred**, because it provides more accurate standard errors and more reliable statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Does Clustered Standard Errors Correction Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustered standard errors correct the estimated **standard errors** when observations within the same group (here: states) may be correlated over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In panel data, we observe the same states across several years. Because of this, the regression errors within a state may be related from one year to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the model makes a large error in one state in one year, it is likely that the error will be similar in the next year for the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustered standard errors allow this type of correlation within each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Cluster Correction Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster correction affects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard errors\n",
    "- t-statistics\n",
    "- p-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster correction does **not affect**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coefficient estimates\n",
    "- R²\n",
    "- Predicted values\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the coefficients in the corrected and uncorrected models are identical, but the standard errors are larger in the clustered model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Cluster Correction Is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Serial correlation was detected in the residuals. When residuals are correlated within states, standard errors from a simple regression are too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustered standard errors fix this problem and give correct statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster correction means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Observations from the same state are allowed to be related over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces more realistic standard errors and more reliable statistical conclusions."

    "##### Interpretation: OLS vs Fixed Effects vs Random Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The table compares three panel data models explaining rice production (**prod**) using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- area planted (**area**)\n",
    "- labor used (**labor**)\n",
    "- fertilizer applied (**fert**)\n",
    "\n",
    "The models differ in how they treat differences between firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coefficient Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient on **area** is positive and statistically significant in all models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OLS: 1.321  \n",
    "- Fixed Effects: 1.661  \n",
    "- Random Effects: 1.560\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that increasing the planted area by one hectare increases rice production by about **1.3–1.7 tonnes**, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient is largest in the Fixed Effects model because it measures changes **within the same firm over time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fertilizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient on **fert** is positive in all models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OLS: 0.005  \n",
    "- Fixed Effects: 0.003  \n",
    "- Random Effects: 0.004\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that increasing fertilizer use increases rice production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is smaller in the Fixed Effects model, suggesting that part of the OLS relationship comes from differences between firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient on **labor** is positive and statistically significant in all models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OLS: 0.028  \n",
    "- Fixed Effects: 0.013  \n",
    "- Random Effects: 0.023\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that additional labor increases rice production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fixed Effects estimate is smaller because it removes permanent productivity differences between firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differences Between Models\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OLS Model\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS ignores firm differences and treats all firms as identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has the highest R² (0.829) because it captures both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- differences between firms\n",
    "- changes over time\n",
    "\n",
    "However, OLS may be biased if firm characteristics affect the regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fixed Effects Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fixed Effects model controls for permanent differences between firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It compares each firm with itself over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R² is lower (0.266) because Fixed Effects removes variation between firms and uses only variation within firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is usually more reliable if firm characteristics are related to area, labor, or fertilizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Random Effects Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Effects allows firms to differ but assumes these differences are random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R² (0.747) lies between OLS and Fixed Effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Effects uses both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- variation between firms\n",
    "- variation within firms\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes Random Effects more efficient than Fixed Effects if the assumptions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overall Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "All three models show that area, labor, and fertilizer increase rice production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients differ across models because they use different sources of variation in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS gives the largest fit but ignores firm differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Effects controls for firm-specific characteristics and focuses on changes within firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Effects is a compromise between OLS and Fixed Effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between Fixed Effects and Random Effects should be based on the **Hausman test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If firm effects are correlated with the regressors, Fixed Effects should be preferred."

    "The coefficients for market value and capital stock are positive and statistically significant in all models. In the Fixed Effects model, a one-unit increase in capital increases investment by about 0.31 million dollars, while a one-unit increase in market value increases investment by about 0.11 million dollars. This indicates that firms invest more when expected profits and desired capital stock increase, which is consistent with the economic theory of investment."
